# Decision Framework

## Purpose
Make decisions that are defensible, reversible when possible, and aligned with long-term sustainability.
Reduce cognitive drag.
Avoid decision theater.

## Default Posture
- Bias toward action with guardrails
- Prefer reversible decisions
- Accept that perfect information is rare
- Progress beats prolonged certainty

If the cost of waiting is higher than the cost of being wrong, decide.

## Decision Tiers
### Tier 1: Reversible, Low Impact
Examples:
- Tooling choices
- Internal libraries
- Minor refactors
- Content and messaging experiments

Approach:
- Decide quickly
- Document lightly
- Move on

### Tier 2: Semi-Reversible, Medium Impact
Examples:
- Architecture patterns
- Vendor selection
- Hiring approach
- Consulting packages or pricing models

Approach:
- Identify 2–3 viable options
- Evaluate against criteria
- Decide and commit

### Tier 3: Hard to Reverse, High Impact
Examples:
- Company direction
- Core platform choices
- Long-term client commitments
- Full-time role acceptance

Approach:
- Slow down intentionally
- Pressure-test assumptions
- Document tradeoffs clearly

## Evaluation Criteria
Primary:
- Long-term maintenance cost
- Cognitive load on future you
- Ease of explanation to a client, recruiter, or teammate

Secondary:
- Cost and pricing predictability
- Vendor or employer lock-in risk
- Talent and support availability

Tertiary:
- Performance edge cases
- Resume or branding optics
- Novelty or trend alignment

Optimize for the top. Accept compromises below.

## Career-Specific Guidance
When evaluating roles or opportunities, prioritize:
- Trust and autonomy over title
- Scope clarity over vague influence
- Decision authority aligned with accountability
- Sustainable expectations, not hero culture

Red flags:
- Undefined ownership
- Constant urgency with no roadmap
- Growth without investment
- Leadership language without follow-through

If the role requires constant self-justification, it is already misaligned.

## Consulting vs Corporate Tradeoffs
### Consulting Biases
Pros:
- Autonomy and flexibility
- Direct client impact
- Clear value exchange

Cons:
- Income variability
- Self-managed pipeline
- Context switching

Choose consulting when:
- You control scope and expectations
- Work aligns with your strengths
- Lifestyle design is a priority

### Corporate Biases
Pros:
- Stability and benefits
- Larger systems and teams
- Long-term platform ownership

Cons:
- Slower decision cycles
- Political overhead
- Misaligned incentives

Choose corporate when:
- The role has real authority
- The problem space is meaningful
- The culture respects boundaries

Neither path is morally superior.
The right choice depends on timing, energy, and goals.

## Build vs Buy Heuristic
Build when:
- The domain is core to differentiation
- Requirements are specific and evolving
- You can maintain it without heroics

Buy when:
- The problem is well understood
- The solution is non-differentiating
- Operating it yourself adds no strategic value

If you would not enjoy owning it for two years, do not build it.

## Timing Discipline
Ask:
- What breaks if I wait?
- What breaks if I act now?
- What is the smallest useful version?

Delay is a decision. Treat it like one.

## Risk Framing
- Name risks explicitly
- Separate known risks from imagined ones
- Mitigate the top two, ignore the rest

If everything feels risky, the scope is wrong.

## Commitment Rule
Once a decision is made:
- Stop re-litigating it
- Execute fully
- Revisit only when new information appears

Second-guessing is not analysis.

## Documentation Rule
- Record why the decision was made
- Capture alternatives considered
- Note revisit triggers

Future you deserves context, not judgment.

## Quick Checklist
Before deciding, confirm:
- Is this reversible?
- What does future me pay for this?
- Can I explain this in two sentences?
- What is the smallest responsible step?
- Am I avoiding a decision or making one?

If the answers are unclear, slow down.
If they are clear, move.
