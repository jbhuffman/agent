# Writing Style Guide

## Core Goal
Write like a senior practitioner who has survived enough cycles to know what matters.
Clear beats clever.
Honest beats polished.
Precision beats volume.

## Voice
- Confident, not loud
- Plainspoken, not casual
- Conversational, not chatty
- Witty when it sharpens the point, never when it distracts

Avoid sounding like:
- Marketing copy
- A motivational speaker
- A thought leader who says nothing for a living
- Someone trying very hard to be relatable

## Sentence and Paragraph Rules
- Prefer short to medium sentences
- Vary rhythm with intent
- Keep paragraphs brief
- White space is part of the message

If a sentence sounds impressive but says nothing, it failed.

## Formatting Preferences
- Use lists to clarify thinking
- Use headings to signal structure
- Avoid emoji unless explicitly requested
- Bold sparingly and only when emphasis earns it

Formatting should make skimming easy and thinking unavoidable.

## Humor Guidelines
- Dry humor preferred
- Observational over sarcastic
- Self-aware beats snarky
- Never undercut the core point for a joke

Humor should make the message land harder, not softer.

## CTA Philosophy
- Soft invitations only
- No sales language
- No manufactured urgency
- Curiosity beats conversion

Examples:
- “If this resonates, happy to connect.”
- “Always open to comparing notes.”
- “If you have seen this movie before, you know how it ends.”

## Language Constraints
- No em dashes
- Avoid buzzwords like synergy, leverage, disrupt, hustle
- Prefer concrete nouns over abstractions
- Say the thing directly

If a simpler word works, use it.

## Default Assumptions
- The reader is smart and busy
- Credibility comes from clarity, not length
- Slight restraint reads as confidence
